/**
 * The read-only surface TriPath exposes to LiftPath.
 *
 * TriPath owns the whole picture — every discipline's load, fuelling, sleep, recovery — so LiftPath
 * no longer computes its own view of any of it. It reads the verdict from here and renders it,
 * keeping its own model only as an offline fallback for when TriPath is absent.
 *
 * This file is duplicated verbatim in LiftPath (`com.liftpath.helpers.TriPathContract`) — two
 * sideloaded apps, no shared module — so [CONTRACT_VERSION], [schemaHash] and [CAPABILITIES] are
 * what let either side notice the other is stale instead of silently reading absent columns.
 *
 * **Bump [CONTRACT_VERSION] in BOTH files whenever a column is added, removed or re-typed, and keep
 * every `SPEC` list identical between the two copies.** `TriPathShareContractTest` pins the schema
 * hash on both sides, so a one-sided edit fails a build rather than the integration.
